      {<span className="bold rose">Job COLumn</span>} is a job board that considers the cost of
      living.
    </p>
    <p>It compares the minimum salary in a listed job with your current salary! Magic!</p>
    <p>
      It doesn't display jobs that don't list a salary (because they'll probably try and scam you
      and I ain't about that life) nor any jobs outside of a set list of the larger cities in the
      UK.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be asking yourself, "But, why?" Cause I said so. Deal with it or don't use my app.
      Bite me. JK ILY please stay &lt;3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nah but for real, of all the jobs that do have salaries, it will show you which jobs will give
      you a better quality of life. Please note this is just about making more money for your time,
      if you're unhappy this site won't change that.

    <p>Now obviously I'll need some information from you to make this app work.</p>
    <p>
      I'll need your current location to compare the consumer price index - CPI (look it up) with
      that of the one in each job's location. If you live in the middle of nowhere, pick your
      closest city.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll also need your current salary for the same reason. Obviously these 2 details alone aren't
      enough to personally identify you if some hacker gets into this super insecure website, but if
      you think that specific combination will out you, just use a close enough value.
